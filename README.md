paper_interfaceModelScaling
===========================

Interface Model Scaling paper written in LaTeX.

On Windows we need to run:

*  git remote rm origin
*  git remote add origin 'git@github.com:markjones112358/paper_interfaceModelScaling.git'

To add the SSH address for the repository (apparently - not sure if you'll have SSH)
Then it should ask for your git username and password.
