\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We report how the impedance presented by a platinum electrode scales with the concentration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
We find that the constant phase element of the model scales with approximately the log of concentration, whereas the resistivity is inversely proportional.
Using a novel DC measurement technique we show that the Faradaic response of a platinum electrode, and thus the safe exposure limit, does not scale with concentration below 900\thinspace mV overpotential across a pair of electrodes.
We compare objective measurements made in saline to those made in the spinal cavity of live sheep. We comment upon the appropriateness of using PBS as a substitute for living sheep.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{here} is considerable interest in the electrical modelling of electrodes. \cite{Cogan2008,Troy2006}
In \cite{Franks2005} a linearised model was presented, and in \cite{ScottSingle2013} a non-linear model
suitable for use with the SPICE circuit simulator was presented. The SPICE model usefully characterises an electrode in a given electrolyte with a small number of parameters.
One major reason for the interest in the electrical impedance of electrodes concerns the design of electronics intended for integration into pacemakers, cochlear implants, spinal cord stimulators, etc. The design of successful circuits depends upon a good understanding of external load impedance, while maximisation of battery life is linked to the use of electrodes whose impedance is well understood.
Having a compact model of an electrode in the appropriate electrolyte allows circuit designers to simulate their designs with valid loads. Knowing the effect upon the model of changes in the electrode or electrolyte would allow designers to anticipate circumstances that will affect the load seen by their circuits. Another appeal of a compact model stems from the fact that electrode characteristics are succinctly and objectively represented by the model parameters. These enable direct comparison of different electrodes, or the change in electrode properties over time. For example, in \cite{Kane13} changes in chronically-implanted electrodes are observed but there is no standard quantitative way of presenting the changes. Similarly, while there is a good understanding of what represents safe exposure, a compact model with parameters permits the prediction of the safety of any given stimulus regime.~\cite{Merrill05}

Electrodes in the laboratory are typically tested in a saline solution selected to mimic the circumstances in which they will operate when implanted.
A 0.1X concentration solution of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) is common in the case of Spinal Cord Stimulators (SCS), while 1.0X PBS is considered more representative of the situation in blood.
In this manuscript we report how the parameters of the non-linear model change as the concentration of saline is varied. We place these parameters in context with a biological measurement made in the spinal cavity of a live sheep.

The electrode used in this work is a commercial linear array of eight platinum electrodes intended for SCS implantation called an ``Octrode''.~\cite{StJudeOctrode} A picture of an Octrode is presented in figure~\ref{fig:octrode}.
The electrical interface model of \cite{Franks2005} and \cite{ScottSingle2013} has two parts, a displacement branch and a Faradaic branch.

\section{Resistive Network}
The ingredients of the stock solution of PBS used in this study are given in table~\ref{tab:PBSrecipe}.
Six solutions ranging from 1.0X to 0.025X the concentration of this stock solution have been examined.
The stock solution had a pH of 7.4 and no pH adjustments were made to the derived solutions.

The electrical impedance between two electrodes in an electrolyte arises from two interface impedances in series with the resistance due to the bulk of the electrolyte itself. To quantify the impedance presented by a single interface we first need to understand the inter-electrode resistances presented by the electrolyte bulk. As there are always two interface impedances between any two electrodes, inter-electrode resistances cannot be measured in isolation.
In \cite{ScottSingle2013}, a series of transresistance measurements were used in conjunction with a physical description of the electrode geometry to build up a representative network of resistors. Repeating this work, we can then produce a resistor network that connects each of the 8 electrodes, replicating the resistances due to the solution bulk. Transimpedance measurements were taken at each concentration of PBS and the results are presented in figure~\ref{fig:transresistance}.
A numerical fit was made to the two independent scaling parameters ($R_{eri}$ and $R_{sri}$).  The resulting fit and parameter values are presented in figure~\ref{fig:transresistance} and table~\ref{tab:RESparams} respectively.

\section{Displacement Parameters}
The linear, or small-signal, part of an electrode-electrolyte interface is represented by a Constant Phase Element (CPE) or fractional capacitor. For simulation purposes this element is realised as an array of R-C branches.~\cite{ScottSingle2013,Morrison59,Elwakil10} Measurement of the CPE is made by sweeping the frequency of a sinusoidal stimulus across electrodes 2 and 7 of the Octrode while measuring the voltage between electrodes 2 and 3. The numbering pattern used to identify each of the electrodes on the Octrode is shown in figure~\ref{fig:octrode}.
Measurements made using this configuration allow for the quantification of a single interface impedance in series with the resistance presented by the bulk solution.
Figures~\ref{fig:CPE_Magnitude} and~\ref{fig:CPE_Phase} show magnitude and phase measurements of the CPE at each concentration.

As shown in the interface model schematic (figure~\ref{fig:schematic}), the interface contains its own internal series resistance ($R_{S}$). The resistance seen in series with the CPE will therefore be the sum of both the resistance due to the bulk resistivity of the fluid and $R_{S}$, to which we will refer as $R_{S+bulk}$.
In figure~\ref{fig:CPE_Magnitude}, the slope and magnitude of the CPE are visible below 1\thinspace Hz whereas $R_{S+bulk}$  dominates above 1\thinspace kHz; it is clear that the two do not scale similarly.
As the impedance of the CPE and $R_{S+bulk}$ are separable with frequency, these measurements can be used to determine the CPE parameters and $R_{S}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:CPE_Scaling} shows measured data and the corresponding fits for both the CPE magnitude at 0.05\thinspace Hz and $R_{S+bulk}$.
The resulting model parameters $m$, $k$, and $|Z|\thinspace @\thinspace 1Hz$ are shown in table~\ref{tab:CPEparams}. Here we express the CPE offset parameter as $|Z|\thinspace @ \thinspace 1Hz$, but the fits used $|Z|\thinspace @ \thinspace 0.05Hz$, as data points at this frequency are outside the transitional zone where the impedance of the CPE and that of $R_{S+bulk}$ overlap.

From the results shown in figure~\ref{fig:CPE_Magnitude} we observe that the salinity of the electrolyte does not affect the slope of the CPE's impedance and the magnitude shifts relatively little. This suggests that the CPE does not rely on the added ions but they do have an effect, implying that its behaviour is a property of platinum and $H_{2}O$.

\section{Faradaic Parameters}

With parameters fitted for the scaling of both the CPE and $R_{S}$ with PBS concentration, we evaluate Faradaic conduction. The interface model uses two reverse connected diodes to reproduce the exponential behaviour of Faradaic current conduction, implied by the Butler-Volmer equation. We wish to measure this conduction by separating it from the displacement behaviour of the CPE. By using a DC measurement technique, as opposed to cyclic measurements, we are able to separate the effects in time. Like a conventional capacitor, when the voltage across the CPE changes, it responds by absorbing or ejecting charge, causing a spike in current. The CPE will draw negligible current once it has settled and in the case of our model we assume the remaining current conduction to be the result of Faradaic processes. The equation governing current conduction in a diode where the forward voltage across the diode, $V_{D}$, is small is
\begin{equation}
    I = i_{0}  e^{V_{D} / n V_{T}}
\end{equation}
where $V_{T}$ is the thermal voltage and is approximately 25\thinspace mV at a temperature of 300\thinspace K. We wish to find how the saturation current ($i_{0}$) and the ideality factor ($n$) scale as the solution salinity is varied.

Faradaic measurements were made using an Agilent E5270B Precision Measurement Mainframe producing a stepped DC voltage stimulus across electrodes 2 and 6 whilst continuously measuring the output current. We commenced with 1.0X concentration of the stock solution (table~\ref{tab:PBSrecipe}). This solution was progressively diluted in factors of two between each measurement. The solution was mixed continuously by inductive stirrer and the electrode remained submerged throughout the entire process.
A single measurement run involved stepping the voltage across electrodes 2 and 7 from 0.5\thinspace V to 1.2\thinspace V in increments of 0.05\thinspace V; this range was previously determined to capture the onset of Faradaic conduction.

In \cite{Cogan2008} it has been noted that results obtained using cyclic voltammetry are dependant on, among other factors, the measurement sweep rate. This indicates a lack of isolation between displacement and Faradaic mechanisms. Our measurements were repeated using wait-times of 4, 16, 32 and 64 seconds between voltage increments, allowing us to determine the effect of sweep rate. From these measurements and a separate investigation\footnote{A separate measurement of the response of the CPE to voltage increments is shown in figure~\ref{fig:CPE_currentVsTime}. We concluded that the measurement rate did not significantly affect results when using a wait-time of 64 seconds or greater when the applied voltage across both interfaces is beyond 0.7\thinspace V. These measurements were made in still solution and we expect that stirring will cause the CPE to come to equilibrium sooner. The wait time used between increments for this data was 10,000 seconds, of which only the first 250 seconds are shown. We believe these results give confidence to our assumption that a wait-time of 64 seconds is ``long enough''.} we concluded that a wait-time of 64 seconds was sufficient.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{graphics/CPE_currentVsTime}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Current versus time after a stepped voltage increment across a pair of interfaces. Time before 64 seconds is highlighted in grey. Measurements were taken with a wait time of 10,000 seconds between increments.}
    \label{fig:CPE_currentVsTime}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:StepResponse_Faradaic}, electrical current measurements are plotted against time (solid lines). Each spike marks the point at which the voltage is incremented. We expect the peak current to be much higher than is shown since each measurement point is the average of 300 samples taken over 1 second. Note that the amount of charge absorbed by the CPE increases with concentration of PBS, but the current for each concentration converges to approximately the same value. Dotted lines have been added that link the electrical current measurements taken 10 seconds after each increment for 0.125X PBS (lower trace) and 1.0X PBS (upper trace). These dotted traces show results typical of cyclic methods, where the electrode overpotential is never constant. This illustrates the benefit of using DC measurements when measuring Faradaic currents.

Figure~\ref{fig:faradaic_logCurrentVsVoltage} shows the settled currents plotted on a log scale, versus the voltage applied across the electrodes. This uses the same data as the previous figure but has been processed so that each point represents the average of the final 24 current measurements at each step. Below 0.9\thinspace V it appears that the concentration of the solution had no identifiable effect on Faradaic conduction as the traces are not monotonic with concentration in this region.  Between 0.9\thinspace V and 1.05\thinspace V (concentration dependent) a transition occurs which results in current conduction becoming dependent on solution concentration.
Above 1.05\thinspace V the traces diverge showing clear dependence upon concentration.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{graphics/currentTimeFaradaicCPE_Stacked_IEEE}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Current conduction with 0.05\thinspace V stepped voltage increments from 0.5\thinspace V to 0.9V. Each voltage is held for 64 seconds before being further incremented. Dotted lines connect current measurements occurring 10 seconds after an increment.}
    \label{fig:StepResponse_Faradaic}
\end{figure}

We attribute the change in behaviour between 0.9\thinspace V and 1.05\thinspace V to a transition to diffusion-controlled conduction.
We hypothesise that the charging of the CPE draws available ions to the electrode, creating a layer of high ionic concentration at the surface irrespective of that of the solution bulk. It is this layer that is subsequently consumed by the Faradaic reactions at a rate dependent on the log of the electrode overpotential.  The effect of bulk solution concentration while this layer has formed is negligible until the point at which the layer is consumed faster than it can be replenished. At this stage, and with increasing overpotential, the Faradaic conduction is governed by diffusion of ions from the bulk into the layer, the rate of which increases with the ion concentration in the bulk. We believe this explains the divergence of conduction with concentration between 0.9\thinspace V and 1.05\thinspace V and why there is no observable dependence on bulk ion concentration beforehand.

This hypothesis intimately links the Faradaic component to the CPE, where the latter is a precursor to the former. For the purposes of our model, we are content with placing a limit of 0.9\thinspace V across the pair of interfaces and using the assumption that Faradaic conduction does not change with concentration. Further investigation into modelling this relationship is needed. We hope to publish this in a follow-up paper.

\section{In-vivo measurements of sheep}

    \caption{Cross section of a sheep spine showing the position of the electrode array relative to the dura. Spotted regions represent cross sectioned vertebrae.}
    \label{fig:sheepSpine}
\end{figure}

We now test the claim that 0.1X PBS is a reasonable representation of the spine of a living sheep.
The displacement measurements were repeated inside the spinal canal of a live sheep, just outside the dura as shown in figure~\ref{fig:sheepSpine}. The sheep were prepared and anaesthetised using the procedures described in \cite{Parker2013} under the Animal Care and Ethics Committee approval of the Royal North Shore Hospital. The study complied with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. The measurements are presented in figures~\ref{fig:displacement_sheepCPEMagnitude} and~\ref{fig:displacement_sheepCPEPhase} on top of the array of traces for saline taken from figures~\ref{fig:CPE_Magnitude}
and~\ref{fig:CPE_Phase}.
Although it is clear that there are complications in vivo, a 0.25X PBS saline offers a good approximation to the resistive part of the trace.
The reactive part would be better modelled by a solution of less than 0.025X concentration.

\section{Conclusion}

We have used the parameters of a compact electrical model of an implantable electrode as a way of objectively comparing scenarios.
We have measured how changing the concentration of PBS affects the parameters.
We have drawn direct relationships with concentration sufficient to predict interface characteristics at arbitrary dilutions of PBS.
We found that the CPE moves much more slowly with concentration whereas the resistance moved almost linearly.
Using DC measurements we conclude that the salinity of the bulk does not affect Faradaic conduction until a threshold voltage is reached. We hypothesise that this is because the CPE is setting the effective concentration of ions in a localised volume surrounding each electrode. In-vivo measurements of the CPE in sheep spine showed that no single concentration of PBS matches both the CPE and the resistive characteristics at once. Nevertheless, 0.1X PBS is a good compromise.

6. Since the electrode model includes two back-to-back diodes, I think it would be valuable to sweep the voltage from -1.2V to +1.2V.\\
{\color{OliveGreen}
    {\color{Red} The diodes are identical, this is moving into polarisation territory again. In effect, they are both being used (one by + and other by -). I don't know what to say about this. We wanted to make all the measurements happen in as little time as possible. We have data from sweeps in the other direction, not DC though.}

7. There is a big difference between blue dots and red curve in Fig. 10, except for the "voltage increment time" and "64 seconds after increment".  This indicates to me that the CPE model is NOT that accurate, as the settling curve is highly correlated to the CPE parameters.\\
{\color{OliveGreen}
    {\color{Red} This is true, try and pinpoint exactly why this is happening. Why does the CPE perform so well in the CPE frequency response plots yet so poorly in the Faradaic part?}

In this manuscript, the authors report how the non-linear electrode-electrolyte interface model parameters change as a function of saline solution concentration. This is a very interesting and important subject that could be potentially of great importance for readers of IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits ans Systems. The manuscript is well written and adequately referenced. However, the reviewer would like to pose a few questions to the authors to clarify some  issues in the manuscript, which should be addressed.\\

Finally, and most importantly, the part of in vivo measurements are very limited since only one spinal channel measurement has been performed. My opinion is that this manuscript could be even better without this uncertain (n=1) result and thus I recommend to leave this part out.\\

Authors
The aim of this paper, to find a SPICE model of implanted electrodes, is important and the results presented in the paper are interesting. However, as it stands the paper is not well written and must be revised. The weaknesses of the paper are an unclear structure, with results and discussion mixed, poor attention to detail and inaccurate use of words.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

Concerning the experiments, I have two points to make.

1. You do not explain how the impedance measurements have been made (Figs 4, 5 13 & 14). I want to know how much charge was being applied to these electrodes at low frequencies (e.g. 0.05 Hz): what potential excursion occurred was it really a ``small signal''?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

2. I think that the classical view of the electrochemistry of Pt in saline (as, for example, expressed in your ref 1), is that the electrolysis reactions (oxygen and hydrogen evolution) start with a potential difference of about 1.4V. Below this p.d., the likeliest reaction is reduction of oxygen at the cathode which could accompany oxygen evolution from water at the anode. Your paper lacks any consideration of the chemistry but this is a important fault in the stepped-current experiment. Was the solution in equilibrium with air before the experiment? If this is a model for electrodes in vivo, should not the PBS have been in equilibrium with gas with the in vivo partial pressure of oxygen? I suggest that you repeat this experiment, at least (i) under air, (ii) under nitrogen, & perhaps (iii) under in vivo partial pressure of oxygen. The stirring arrangements ought to be exactly described too because liquid flow may be critical.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

Other points

1. P1, top RH col. ``0.1X'' ought to be explained when you first use this form.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

2. Should the resistor model of the volume conductor from [4] be shown in this paper? It would make the paper easier to understand for your reader if you showed the model. If you are not going to do so, you might help them by saying something like ``Readers are advised to see [4] to understand the meaning of the parameters in Table II''.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

3. You say (p2 line 43) that there are 2 independent scaling factors. Is Rli independent or not? If not, why input it in Table II?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

4. In the legend of Fig 4 and in paragraph below, you say this is magnitude of the CPE. But surely it is not since the sloping lines become horizontal. It is the CPE in series with something. But what is this something? Is it the total series resistance or have you already subtracted the volume resistance (found in section II)?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

5. The previous point is complicated by your statement that Rs (Fig 2) is an addition to the volume resistance (p2 RH col). Why is Rs necessary? Is it because the resistance values at high frequencies in Fig 4 are not consistent with the values from the resistor network found in section II? If so, this would be very interesting and I would like you to bring this out.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

6. P2, col 2, line 24: why 2 & 7?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

7. P2, col 2, line 53: ``implying that its behaviour is a property of Pt and water''. Previous authors have thought this showed that the CPE depended on the geometry (surface roughness) of the electrode. Did you mean that, or were you thinking of the electrochemical properties of Pt. Please make clearer.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

8. You do not explain why, in eq 1, you want to use this form. Why nVt? I suppose it isso you can use a standard SPICE form rather than this suits the data. Is that right?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

9. P3, col 2, line 31: why 2 and 6?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

10. P3, col 2, line 36. I guess you mean what is usually called a Magnetic Stirrer. Not ``inductive'' surely?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

11. P3 footnote. ``The response of the CPE'': this is confusing! Surely this is the response of a pair of electrodes? The CPE is an element of your model.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

12. Fig 11 legend ``Simulated and measured response of the interface model''. Surely you mean ``Simulated response of the interface model compared to measurement from the electrodes''?\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

13. P5, col 2, line 46 ``the CPE is setting''. Again, you are confusing an element of your model with reality.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

14. P5, col 1, line 49 ``a 0.25X PBS is a good model''.  This seems a very feeble comment on an interesting result. The series resistance part of the in vivo magnitude is a good fit to the 0.25X curve and the slope of the CPS is very similar (though you have exaggerated this by extrapolating nearly 2 decades in frequency below the lowest-frequency measurement). But the impedance at low frequencies is about three times too high. How do you explain that? It cannot be because of the bone and other high-resistivity structures around the electrodes (which would have an effect on the high frequency asymptote). So what is it? Did you measure the electrodes again in PBS after removing from the sheep? Troyk published an interesting paper with measurement from electrodes in brain of zebra finches which showed that anomalous characteristics in vivo vanished as soon as the electrodes were returned to PBS, implying that the phenomenon was not due to some biofilm deposited on the electrodes.\\

\subsection*{Reviewer 4}
{\color{blue}
In this manuscript, the authors studied the impedance of a commercial electrode array as a function of concentration of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), both through simulation and empirical measurements, and compared those results to the impedance measured when the electrode array was implanted into a sheep's spinal cavity. From this comparison, they concluded that the current practice of testing spinal cord stimulator in 0.1x of physiologically normal saline is adequate but suggest that no single concentration of PBS captures the frequency dependence of the in vivo measured impedance.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

Overall, the paper was brief and to the point, which in this case is actually a determent instead of a benefit. Much of the underlying theory and development of parameters appear without informing the reader of their purpose or how they were calculated and/or measured. For example, the parameters in Table 2 (and reported to be in Figure 3) are not explained and what their relationship to the remainder of the manuscript is not provided. To make this manuscript more approachable to a wider audience, I recommend the authors more fully develop Sections II, III, and IV. Further, they should explain their testing in terms of standard electrochemical characterization, detailing their counter, working, and reference electrodes used in measuring impedance. As part of this expansion, the references should be increased beyond the present ten references. Although their current references include clearly important electrode characterization references (Cogan, Merrill et. al, & Kane et. al), the information contained in these references are not effectively used to support the authors’ work.\\
{\color{OliveGreen} Our response}\\

Technically, I found one issue with this paper. In Figure 11, the x-axis labels should have 2 digits after the decimal. As presently shown, each of the labels 0.6, 0.7, ..., 1.0 are repeated twice on the axis. Presumably, the second version of the labels should be 0.65, 0.75, ..., 1.05.\\
